# Bootcamp Challenge 3

## Description

The repository for challenge 3 of my Web Development bootcamp. Here you will find the files required for submission. For this challenge we were tasked with creating javascript that would generate a random password given certain criteria chosen by the user.

## Deployed Application
https://sergluna.github.io/bootcamp-challenge-3/

## Usage

To view my submission please review the index.html file. You will see a "Generate Password" button that when pushed will ask the user questions via prompts. Once all questions have been asked the script will check to see if at least one of the criterias were chosen. If none were chosen then the password will not generate and the user will need to begin the process again.
